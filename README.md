- Movies4Hub4U is a simple movie search and discovery website built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates how to fetch and display movie data from public APIs, and provides a clean, responsive UI for users to search for their favorite movies and shows.

## Features

- üîç **Search for Movies & Shows:**  
  Instantly search for movies and TV shows using the free IMDB API.

- üé≤ **Random Movies on Home:**  
  On page load, the site displays a random selection of movies using the FrankeyJSON API.

- üì• **Download Button (Demo):**  
  Each movie card includes a download button (for demo purposes, links to a sample file).

- üíª **Responsive Design:**  
  Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.

  Used to fetch random movies for the homepage.

## How It Works

- The homepage fetches and displays 50 random movies from FrankeyJSON.
- Users can search for any movie or show using the search bar.
- Search results are fetched from the IMDB free API and displayed as cards.
